    Menu Source & Current Update: https://github.com/CF4x99/Apparition
    IF YOU USE ANY SCRIPTS FROM THIS PROJECT, OR MAKE AN EDIT, LEAVE CREDIT.

    Apparition is open source as a learning opportunity. Please take advantage of that and actually learn from it.
    You will learn nothing from just copying and pasting everything.

    PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE MENU IS CLOSE TO THE CENTER TO MAKE SURE IT IS VISIBLE FOR ANY SCREEN RESOLUTION
    YOU CAN ALWAYS CHANGE IT IN 'menu_customization.gsc' WHERE ALL OF THE DEFAULT MENU VARIABLES ARE SET
    OR YOU CAN JUST USE THE MENU POSITION EDITOR WHILE IN GAME TO SET A CUSTOM POSITION THAT YOU LIKE

    NOTE:
        I can say without a doubt that Apparition will be unmatched in every way.
        It’s the most stable, in-depth, detail-oriented, organized, and flat-out biggest mod menu you’ll ever see.
        I’ve put countless hours into it over the years, across both newer and older games, to get it where it is today.

        You won’t find anything even close to Apparition.
        Not even the menus made by “devs” who keep pulling stuff from it for their own projects.
        Apparition will stay on top no matter who tries to compete.

        Just to clear up any confusion:
            Apparition, including the base, belongs to me (CF4_99) and only me.
            I built it 100% from the ground up.
            I’m the sole developer

        The Credits Below Says Exactly What These People Offered Apparition, Nothing More, Nothing Less.


    Credits:
        - CF4_99 ~ Project Developer
        - Extinct ~ Ideas, Suggestions, Constructive Criticism, and His Spec-Nade
        - CraftyCritter ~ BO3 Compiler
        - ItsFebiven ~ Some Ideas and Suggestions
        - Joel ~ Suggestions, Bug Reports, and Testing The Unique String Crash Protection


    Custom Maps:
        While I have tested Apparition a lot on custom maps, you may run into some issues with a few options not working 100% as they should.

        Known Issues On Custom Maps(Ones that can't, or won't, be fixed):

            Weaponry - Not all weapons are in the right category(Also applies to custom weapon mods):
                ~ I am aware of this. There isn't anything I can do about it. Most of them, if not all, are moved into the 'Specials' Category.


    Map EE Options:
        I have created scripts to complete the EE's for the classic maps that have smaller EE's.
        As for the bigger maps that have bigger and more complex EE's, I have made scripts to make completing the EE's, a lot easier.
        The EE scripts will complete steps properly, not just set flags/variables tricking the game into thinking the step has been completed, when it actually hasn't(unlike other "developers")
        This will prevent any issues with crashes/conflictions later on while continuing regular gameplay/playing through other parts of the EE.

        Where to find options that help completing EE's:
            Main Menu -> [map name] Scripts
            Server Modifications -> Craftables
        
    Craftables:
        Not all craftables will be found in the Craftables menu
        Some craftables have to be added and collected manually
        So if you can't find a craftable in the Craftables menu, check the map scripts menu
        If it's not found in Craftables, or the map scripts menu, then it's a craftable that would have to be added manually, and I haven't made a script to collect the parts yet


    If you find any bugs, or come across something that you feel isn't working as it should, please message me on discord.
